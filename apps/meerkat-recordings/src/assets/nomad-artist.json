      "description": "For this project I wanted to explore new grounds and to combine my roots from Hip-Hop and IDM with instrumental Grime. I wanted my track to sound digital, clean and punchy with a rough edge. I have always been inspired by the UK underground dance scene and wanted to venture out in that direction, but with a more modern sound than previous projects.",

Simultaneously, Ombudsman’s tracks are emotionally ambivalent – never clear cut as happy, sad, aggressive, and especially not accommodating.",
